-- Itâ€™s very similar to the previous version, but instead of making a function
-- that takes a generator and then calls itself recursively with the new updated
-- generator, we do all the work in main . After telling the user whether he was
-- correct in his guess, we update the global generator and then call main again.
-- Both approaches are valid, but I like the first one more since it does less
-- stuff in main and also provides a function I can reuse easily.
